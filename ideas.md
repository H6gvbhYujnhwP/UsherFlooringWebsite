## Idea 1: "Gentleman's Club" — British Heritage Luxury

**Design Movement**: Victorian Gentlemen's Club meets Modern Luxury Interiors — inspired by the bow tie in the logo, this leans into the "smart" branding with a refined, tailored aesthetic.

**Core Principles**:
1. Tailored elegance — every element feels bespoke, like a fitted suit
2. Material honesty — textures that evoke real flooring materials (wood grain, carpet weave)
3. Restrained opulence — rich without being gaudy
4. Typographic authority — strong serif headlines command attention

**Color Philosophy**: Deep charcoal (#1C1C1E) as the primary background evokes sophistication. Warm gold (#C9A96E) as the accent mirrors the warmth of quality wood flooring and signals premium service. Slate grey (#4A4A4C) for secondary surfaces. Cream (#F5F0E8) for text on dark backgrounds — warmer than pure white, feels more luxurious.

**Layout Paradigm**: Asymmetric split-screen sections — large atmospheric photography on one side, content on the other. Sections alternate which side the image appears on, creating a zigzag reading pattern. Full-bleed hero with parallax depth.

**Signature Elements**:
1. Thin gold horizontal rules as section dividers (echoing the bow tie's formality)
2. Subtle wood-grain texture overlays on dark sections
3. Angled section transitions (diagonal clip-paths) suggesting the precision of flooring installation

**Interaction Philosophy**: Smooth, deliberate transitions — nothing flashy. Elements reveal with gentle fade-ups. Hover states use subtle gold underlines. The experience should feel like walking through a well-appointed showroom.

**Animation**: Scroll-triggered fade-in-up for content blocks (staggered 100ms). Hero text types in with a refined cursor effect. Section backgrounds have subtle parallax (0.3x speed). Navigation underline slides smoothly on hover. Image sections have a gentle zoom on scroll.

**Typography System**: "Playfair Display" for headlines (serif, authoritative, British), "DM Sans" for body text (clean, modern, highly readable). Headlines uppercase with generous letter-spacing (0.15em). Body at 16-18px with 1.7 line-height for comfortable reading.

## Idea 2: "Industrial Craft" — Raw Material Meets Precision

**Design Movement**: Industrial Minimalism crossed with Scandinavian Craft — celebrates the raw beauty of flooring materials through stark contrasts and honest presentation.

**Core Principles**:
1. Material-first — let flooring imagery dominate, text serves the visuals
2. Grid precision — mathematical layouts reflecting the precision of professional fitting
3. Contrast drama — deep blacks against warm material tones
4. Functional beauty — every element earns its place

**Color Philosophy**: Near-black (#0D0D0D) backgrounds create a gallery-like void that makes flooring images pop. Copper/bronze (#B87333) accent for CTAs and highlights — industrial yet warm. Warm grey (#2A2A2A) for card surfaces. Off-white (#E8E4DF) for body text — soft enough to avoid harshness.

**Layout Paradigm**: Masonry-inspired grid with oversized hero images. Content sections use a strict 12-column grid with dramatic scale differences — some elements span 8 columns while text sits in 4. Full-width image bands break up content sections.

**Signature Elements**:
1. Thin copper border lines that frame key sections (like picture framing)
2. Oversized numbers for service steps or feature counts
3. Circular image crops for detail shots (like looking through a magnifying glass at material quality)

**Interaction Philosophy**: Snap-like transitions between sections. Images scale slightly on hover revealing more detail. Cursor changes to a custom crosshair on interactive elements, suggesting precision.

**Animation**: Content blocks slide in from alternating sides. Numbers count up when scrolled into view. Hero image has a slow Ken Burns zoom. Section transitions use a subtle wipe effect. Cards lift with shadow on hover.

**Typography System**: "Space Grotesk" for headlines (geometric, industrial, modern), "Inter" for body (clean utility). Headlines in mixed case with tight letter-spacing (-0.02em). Large display sizes (64-80px) for hero text. Body at 16px with 1.6 line-height.

## Idea 3: "Warm Noir" — Cinematic Warmth

**Design Movement**: Film Noir Warmth — the drama of dark cinema combined with the inviting warmth of a beautifully floored home. Think moody interior photography with warm lighting.

**Core Principles**:
1. Atmospheric depth — layered dark tones create visual depth like a well-lit room at dusk
2. Warm invitation — despite the dark palette, the site should feel welcoming, not cold
3. Cinematic framing — content is presented like carefully composed interior shots
4. Confident simplicity — fewer elements, each given room to breathe

**Color Philosophy**: Rich dark brown (#1A1612) as primary — warmer than black, evokes dark wood. Antique gold (#B8963E) for accents and CTAs — the warmth of polished brass fixtures. Dark warm grey (#2C2824) for elevated surfaces. Warm ivory (#F2EDE4) for text — like aged paper, softer than white.

**Layout Paradigm**: Full-viewport hero sections with cinematic aspect ratios. Content sections use wide margins (20% on each side on desktop) creating a "letterbox" feel. Overlapping elements — text cards that overlap image boundaries create depth. Vertical rhythm driven by generous spacing.

**Signature Elements**:
1. Warm gradient overlays on images (transparent dark brown to transparent) creating a dusk-like atmosphere
2. Subtle vignette effect on section backgrounds
3. Decorative bow-tie divider icon between major sections (referencing the logo)

**Interaction Philosophy**: Languid, smooth movements — nothing jarring. Scroll reveals content like curtains opening. Hover states warm up (subtle brightness increase). The experience should feel like being guided through a beautiful home.

**Animation**: Parallax layers at different depths (foreground text, midground images, background textures). Content fades in with a slight upward drift (20px, 600ms ease-out). Hero text reveals word by word. Navigation items have a warm glow on hover. Page transitions use a fade-through-dark effect.

**Typography System**: "Cormorant Garamond" for headlines (elegant serif, warm character), "Outfit" for body (geometric sans, modern readability). Headlines in title case with moderate letter-spacing (0.05em). Display sizes 48-72px. Body at 17px with 1.75 line-height for luxurious reading.
